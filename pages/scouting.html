                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">What is scouting?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Scouting can mean different things for different people, but the fundamentals of scouting are the same for everyone. There are multiple groups: Bevers, which is the very first for children aged 5 to 7. After that, you have the Welpen, for ages 7 to 11 years. Following them, you have the Scouts for ages 11 to 15 years. Now we get to the category I'm part of: the Explorers, for ages 15 to 18. As the last group, you have Roverscouts for ages 18 to 21. You go on camps together, play games, build bonds, and learn basic survival skills. Outside of that, it's great for the development of children, giving you experiences and fun memories that school could never provide. From the Bevers to the Scouts, everything is planned for you, but once you reach the Explorers, things become quite different.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">When you reach the Explorers, you have to work together even more, because then you have to plan your camps and activities "on your own." The reason why I put "on your own" in quotation marks is because you do have two supervisors. They basically stay out of everything unless it is absolutely necessary to step in. It is a preparation because when you reach Roverscouts, you will be without supervisors. The beautiful thing about scouting is that you're never alone. It's like one big family. Every year you have a summer camp for one week, and you get to know everyone on a whole new level.</p>
                
                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">What does scouting mean to me</h3>
                <p class="mb-5">I started scouting at 5 years old, and I still go to scouting today. To me, it means more than just an activity—it is part of me. I'm surrounded by people who I now consider family. It's beautiful to see everyone helping each other. It's not just the <a href="https://www.hartelgroep.nl" class="text-decoration-none" style="color: #A64B86;">"Hartelgroep"</a>, I see it everywhere, even in different countries.</p>

                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">The Jamboree - 2023 South Korea</h3>
                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-3">What is the Jamboree?</h4>
                <p class="mb-4">The Jamboree, often called the World Scout Jamboree, is a large gathering of Scouts from all over the world that typically occurs every four years. It’s organized by the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) and aims to promote cultural exchange, friendship, and peace among young people globally. The event includes activities like camping, outdoor games, educational workshops, and cultural presentations. Each Jamboree has a theme that emphasizes aspects like environmental responsibility, global citizenship, and personal development.</p>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-3">My experience</h4>
                <p class="mb-5">I attended the 2023 Jamboree in South Korea. It was an experience of a lifetime, filled with unexpected events like floods, heat waves, and hurricanes, yet the spirit remained strong. We were one big family, regardless of where we came from. I am eternally grateful for the opportunity to experience this event and the global sense of community it provided.</p>
