                <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">What is Scouting?</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Scouting is a global movement that means different things to different people, but its foundation remains the same: community, growth, and personal development. It begins with the Bevers (ages 5–7), then progresses to Welpen (7–11), Scouts (11–15), Explorers (15–18), and finally Roverscouts (18–21). Participants engage in outdoor adventures, develop life skills, and forge lasting friendships through games, challenges, and annual camps. While the younger groups follow organized programs, Explorers gain more independence—planning their own activities and camps with minimal supervision, preparing them for the next stage: Rovers.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-5">
                    For Toon van Berkel, this structure built a foundation for leadership and self-reliance. By the time participants reach the Explorer phase, they are empowered to take initiative and work as a team—skills that go far beyond scouting. One of the most beautiful aspects is the unshakable sense of belonging. Whether around a campfire or on a trail, scouts are never alone. It becomes one big, supportive family.
                </p>

                <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">What Scouting Means to Toon van Berkel</h2>
                <p class="mb-5">
                    Toon joined scouting at the age of five and has been a proud member ever since. For him, it’s more than just a weekend activity—it’s a way of life. Scouting has shaped his character, taught him collaboration, and connected him to people he now calls family. Through his local group, <a href="https://www.hartelgroep.nl" class="text-decoration-none" style="color: #A64B86;">Hartelgroep</a>, and even across borders, Toon has witnessed the strength of the international scouting spirit. The movement’s values—kindness, teamwork, and resilience—have left a lifelong impact.

                <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">The 2023 World Scout Jamboree – South Korea</h2>

                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-3">What Is the Jamboree?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The World Scout Jamboree is an extraordinary gathering held every four years, bringing together scouts from around the globe to celebrate unity and global citizenship. Organized by the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM), the event includes cultural exchanges, environmental workshops, outdoor survival experiences, and themed activities focused on leadership and peace. Each Jamboree is a chance to build lifelong connections and gain insight into diverse worldviews.

                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-3">Toon’s Experience in South Korea</h3>
                <p>
                    Toon van Berkel was honored to be part of the 2023 World Scout Jamboree in South Korea. Despite facing extreme weather conditions—heatwaves, flooding, and even a hurricane—he describes the event as life-changing. The challenges only strengthened the bond between scouts from different continents. Together, they shared stories, cultures, and hope for a better future. Toon reflects on the event as one of the most powerful experiences of his life, where global friendship truly came to life.
