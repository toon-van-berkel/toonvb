                <h2>Scouting</h2><br>
                <h3>What is scouting?</h3>
                <p>Scouting can mean different things for different people, but the fundamentals of scouting are the same for everyone. There are multiple groups: Bevers, which is the very first for children aged 5 to 7. After that, you have the Welpen, for ages 7 
                    to 11 years. Following them, you have the Scouts for ages 11 to 15 years. Now we get to the category I'm part of: the Explorers, for ages 15 to 18. As the last group, you have Roverscouts for ages 18 to 21. You go on camps together, play games, 
                    build bonds, and learn basic survival skills. Outside of that, it's great for the development of children, giving you experiences and fun memories that school could never provide. From the Bevers to the Scouts, everything is planned for you, but 
                    once you reach the Explorers, things become quite different.</p><br>
                <p>When you reach the explorers you have to work together even more, because then you have to plan your camps and activites "on your own". The reason why I put on your own in qoutation marks is becuase you do have two supervisors, they basicly stay
                    out of everything that happens unless it is absolutly neccesary to step in. It is a preperation because when you reach Roverscouts you will be withoout supervisors. The beuatifull thing about scouting is that you're never alone. It's like
                    one big family. Every year you have a summercamp which is one week. You get to learn everyone on a entire different level than before, you eat together you sleep together, you travel togehter.</p> <br> <br>
                <h3>What does scouting mean to me</h3>
                <p>I started scouting at 5 years old, even to this day I still go to scouting. To me it means more than just an activity, it is part of me. Im surrounded by people who I at this point would very wel consider family. It's so beuatifull to see everyone
                    wanting to help eachother. It's not just the
                    <a href="https://www.hartelgroep.nl">"Hartelgroep"</a> I can see it everywhere, even in different countries.

                <h3>The Jamboree - 2023 South-Korea</h3><br>
                <h4>What is the Jamboree</h4>
                <p>The Jamboree, often called the World Scout Jamboree, is a large gathering of Scouts from all over the world that typically occurs every four years. It's organized by the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) and aims to promote cultural 
                    exchange, friendship, and peace among young people globally. The first World Scout Jamboree was held in London, England, in 1920, and since then, it has been hosted in various countries, providing a unique opportunity for Scouts to come together 
                    and share their experiences, skills, and traditions. The event includes a wide range of activities such as camping, outdoor games, educational workshops, community service projects, and cultural presentations.Each Jamboree has a theme that guides 
                    its activities and programs, emphasizing aspects like environmental responsibility, global citizenship, and personal development. The event not only allows Scouts to learn new skills but also helps them develop a sense of global community and 
                    understanding across diverse cultures.</p><br>
                <h4>My experience</h4>
                <p>I went to the one in 2023 which was in South-korea. It was an experience of a lifetime, I can go on and on about all the things we did there. It was probably one of the craziest Jamboree's ever. From floods, to heat waves, to huricans, mosquito's 
                    the size of your thumb and even a lack of water. Besides all that it didn't kill the mood, it was like we were all one big family. Eating with different groups of different countries, from Japenese to Americans to Mexicans. At the Jamboree it 
                    didn't matter were you came from your welcome. I was able to leave money in my tent and it wasn't stolen. It gave me an inside what a potentional peaceful world would look like. It was wonderful to experience that, im eternally grateful for the 
                    uppertunity to see and experience it.</p>
