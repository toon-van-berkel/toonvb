        <h2>Scouting</h2><br>
        <h3>What is scouting?</h3>
        <p>Scouting can mean different things for different people. But the fundemental of scouting is the same for everyone. There multiple groups, Bevers which is the very first for children the age of 5 to 7. After that you have the welpen, this is for
            the ages 7 to 11 years. After that you have the scouts 11 to 15 years. Now we get to the catagory im part of the Explorers this is for the ages 15 to 18. As the last group you have Roverscouts 18 to 21. You go on camps together play games
            build bonds and learn basic survival skills. Outisde of that it's great for the development of children, it gives you experiences and fun memories that school could never give. From the bevers to the scouts everything is planned for you, but
            once you reach the exporers things become quite different.</p><br>
        <p>When you reach the explorers you have to work together even more, because then you have to plan your camps and activites "on your own". The reason why I put on your own in qoutation marks is becuase you do have two supervisors, they basicly stay
            out of everything that happens unless it is absolutly neccesary to step in. It is a preperation because when you reach Roverscouts you will be withoout supervisors. The beuatifull thing about scouting is that you're never alone. It's like
            one big family. Every year you have a summercamp which is one week. You get to learn everyone on a entire different level than before, you eat together you sleep together, you travel togehter.</p> <br> <br>
        <h3>What does scouting mean to me</h3>
        <p>I started scouting at 5 years old, even to this day I still go to scouting. To me it means more than just an activity, it is part of me. Im surrounded by people who I at this point would very wel consider family. It's so beuatifull to see everyone
            wanting to help eachother. It's not just the
            <a href="https://www.hartelgroep.nl">"Hartelgroep"</a> I can see it everywhere, even in different countries.

        <h4>What is the Jamboree</h4>
        <p>The Jamboree is a event for scouts which exures every 4 years.</p><br>
