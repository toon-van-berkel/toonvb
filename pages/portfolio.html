                    <p class="project__description">This is my old portfolio website, I decided to replace it with my own website. This was mainly because I was limited and the link was terrible. Having toonvb.com is a lot better.</p>

                    <p class="project__description">For AnimeKnow I took inspiration from Fandom, this is an website will all the information about basicly any show or any character. I designed AnimeKnow to make it easier to Navigate through animes. This could be used by poeple who create there own what if based on anime, to quickly get all the information about a character.</p>

                    <p class="project__description">AnimeShow is a sort of replacement for 9anime. With 9anime you constantly get popups and ads everywhere you go. With Animeshow the tought is that you get 1 ad at the beginning of a episode or show that lasts for 30 seconds. But for movies 1 minute. This way the website stays usable and easy to navigate.</p>
