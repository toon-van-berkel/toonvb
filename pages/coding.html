                <h2 class="fw-bolder">My Coding Journey: Building a Minecraft Server</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Ever since I started playing Minecraft, I was fascinated by the endless possibilities the game offered. From building castles to exploring vast biomes, Minecraft was my playground. But I wanted something more – to play together with friends.</p>
    
                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Why a Minecraft Server?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Playing in our own worlds felt a bit lonely in a game all about creativity and collaboration. I wanted to bring my friends together in a shared world where we could build, explore, and work on projects as a team. The idea of running my own server was both exciting and challenging – I would have full control over the environment and rules of the game.</p>
    
                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Learning the Basics</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">While my friends were busy building with diamond blocks in their solo worlds, I was learning about port forwarding, server management, and configuration files. It wasn’t easy; I had to dive deep into coding, understand how servers work, and figure out the setup from scratch. But the thought of playing together kept me motivated.</p>
    
                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">The First Launch</h3>
                <p class="mb-5">Finally, after hours of research and tweaking, the server was ready. I invited my friends, and we all joined together in the same world for the first time. It was incredible to see everyone collaborating, building massive structures, and going on adventures together. Our server became our virtual hangout, where we could connect, create, and just have fun.</p>
                
                <h3 class="fw-bold mt-4">Learning Python with Arduino</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">Later, during high school, I had the chance to dive deeper into programming by learning Python in combination with Arduino. This experience built on my earlier server project and opened up new possibilities, from simple automation to experimenting with hardware. The lessons were an essential part of my journey, sparking ideas for future projects and giving me a solid foundation in coding.</p>
