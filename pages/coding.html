                <h1 class="fw-bolder">Coding Journey – Building a Minecraft Server</h1>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    For Toon van Berkel, Minecraft was more than a game — it was a gateway into the world of coding and technology. From exploring vast biomes to constructing intricate builds, he quickly realized that the game had even more potential when shared with others.
                </p>

                <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">The Drive to Build Something Bigger</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    While many enjoyed their solo Minecraft worlds, Toon wanted to go further — he envisioned a shared server where friends could collaborate, build, and play together in real time. This desire sparked his curiosity in server hosting, and with no prior experience, he set out to create one from scratch.
                </p>

                <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">Learning Through Experimentation</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    As his peers were stacking diamond blocks, Toon dove into port forwarding, configuration files, and command-line tools. Setting up a functional Minecraft server taught him valuable lessons in networking, file systems, and troubleshooting — all through self-guided learning. It was challenging, but the thought of connecting everyone in a shared world kept him motivated.
                </p>

                <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">Launching the First Server</h2>
                <p class="mb-5">
                    After countless hours of research and testing, Toon launched his first server. The moment his friends joined and began building together was unforgettable. The server became their digital playground — a space to collaborate, go on adventures, and create memories. It was also a proud achievement that showcased Toon's initiative and ability to bring an idea to life through code.
                </p>

                <h2 class="fw-bold mt-4">Expanding into Python & Arduino</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Toon's interest in development didn’t stop there. In high school, he explored Python in combination with Arduino. These hands-on experiences with hardware and automation expanded his understanding of real-world applications. From writing basic scripts to controlling sensors, he began to see the full potential of programming across both software and physical systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What started as a simple desire to host a game server became the foundation for Toon’s journey into IT — a journey built on curiosity, creativity, and continuous learning.
