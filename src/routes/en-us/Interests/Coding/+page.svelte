            <h1>Toon van Berkel and his coding journey</h1>
            <p>
                “Coding is the new language of the world.” That is what Toon van Berkel 
                believes—and like any powerful language, it can build  incredible things 
                or break them in seconds. A single change in logic can ripple through 
                systems, products, and entire platforms. That responsibility is exactly 
                what makes software development so fascinating to him.
                <br><br>
                Toon has deep respect for the open-source community: thousands of developers 
                who share tools, libraries, and ideas that power the modern internet—often 
                without recognition. Thanks to open licenses and a culture of collaboration, 
                innovation is not locked behind big companies alone. Many of the technologies 
                people use every day are built by individuals and communities who started with 
                nothing more than curiosity, a keyboard, and a problem to solve.
                <br><br>
                For Toon, coding is not just writing lines of text—it is shaping experiences, 
                improving workflows, and creating systems that people can rely on. It is 
                creativity with consequences, and that is exactly why he loves it.

            <h2>His experiences</h2>
            <p>
                Toon van Berkel has built a strong foundation in coding and technology through 
                hands-on learning and real-world curiosity. After experiencing a security incident in 
                the past, he became interested in how online attacks happen and—more importantly—how
                to prevent them. That moment showed him how fragile digital accounts can be, and how 
                valuable good habits like strong passwords, secure backups, and privacy-aware choices 
                really are.
                <br><br>
                Since then, Toon has focused on understanding how the internet works, how systems fail, 
                and how to reduce risk through smarter design and better security practices. In the 
                future, he aims to use that experience to build safer products and help others become 
                more aware of the risks that come with being online.
