                    This portfolio is a collection of projects, experiments, and ideas that
                    Toon van Berkel has built over the years. From front-end design and
                    animations to complete web apps—everything with a focus on creativity,
                    clean execution, and the joy of building.

                Toon van Berkel has worked on a wide range of projects—coding, photography, 
                drone work, 3D printing, logo design, poster design, and website design, to 
                name a few. He enjoys the variety that comes with creating new things; if 
                it’s always the same, it’s simply not for him.
